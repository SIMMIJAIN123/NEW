Aggregation is when one object has another object, but both objects can live independently. Objects can exist separately
Composition is when one object contains another object, and the contained object cannot exist without the container object.

If the parent object is deleted, the child object can still exist.
If the parent object is deleted, the child object is also deleted. The contained object is part of the container.
